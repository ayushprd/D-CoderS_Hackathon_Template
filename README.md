## Team 43 - Events Info Page


### Project Overview
----------------------------------
In a popular college like ours, multiple Events are organised in the campus every week. However, due to a lack of common medium, people often miss out on the important of details such as date of event, venue etc.
To solve this problem, we have built a Web App on which everyone can easily find out about the various Events being held in the college.


### Solution Description
----------------------------------
On this Web App, 
* The **event organizers** or the **admins** can create new events, update and delete events.
* **Students** can see events segreagated into three categories: past, currrent and future events. To be reminded for an pqrticular event they can save an upcoming event to their personal calendar using our **Add to Calendar** method. They can also search for a particular event using the search feature.

### Features :
* Addition, updation and deletion of events.
* Classification of events into: past, current and upcoming.
* Countdown Timer
* **[Bonus ]:** Add to personal calendar for receiving remminder about an event
* **[Bonus ]:** Search for a particular event using the search bar.
* Persistent data storage.
* Responsive to both Desktop and Mobile screens.
